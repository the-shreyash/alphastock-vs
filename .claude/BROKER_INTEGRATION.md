# StockAssist AI
## Broker Integration Documentation

Version: 1.0

Status: Active Development

---

# Purpose

This document defines how StockAssist AI integrates with stock brokers.

Broker integration enables users to:

• Connect brokerage accounts

• View live portfolio

• View holdings

• View positions

• Place orders

• Modify orders

• Cancel orders

• Track execution

• Receive real-time updates

• Automatically upgrade their market data feed to the broker's streaming WebSocket (see MARKET_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md)

The platform never stores user credentials directly.

Only secure tokens and broker-approved authentication methods are used.

---

# Design Principles

The broker layer must be:

Provider Independent

Secure

Reliable

Scalable

Event Driven

Real-Time

Future Ready

Every broker should implement the same interface.

The Trading Engine should never know which broker is connected.

---

# Supported Brokers

## Phase 1

Zerodha Kite Connect

Upstox API

---

## Phase 2

Angel One SmartAPI

Groww (if public APIs become available)

Dhan

Fyers

Alice Blue

---

## Phase 3

Interactive Brokers

Alpaca

Binance (Crypto)

International Brokers

# Broker Adapter Pattern

Every broker must implement the same interface.

Example

↓

Zerodha Adapter

↓

Upstox Adapter

↓

Angel Adapter

↓

Future Brokers

Adding a new broker should require only a new adapter.

No changes to Trading Engine.

---

# Broker Interface

Every broker adapter must support:

connect()

disconnect()

refreshSession()

syncPortfolio()

syncOrders()

syncHoldings()

placeOrder()

modifyOrder()

cancelOrder()

getPositions()

getFunds()

getMargins()

getOrderHistory()

getTradeHistory()

subscribeMarketData()

unsubscribeMarketData()

healthCheck()

# Authentication

Preferred

OAuth

Fallback

Broker Approved Login

Never store:

Passwords

PIN

OTP

Security Questions

Only store encrypted access tokens and refresh tokens where supported.

# Market Data Upgrade

Connecting a broker does more than enable trading.

The moment a broker connection becomes active, the Source Manager automatically switches the user's market data source from Yahoo Finance to the broker's streaming WebSocket.

broker.connected

↓

Source Manager re-resolves the user's best provider

↓

Market Gateway opens the broker WebSocket (make-before-break)

↓

User's entire experience upgrades to live streaming:
prices, portfolio, orders, P&L, watchlist, scanner, AI context

The user does NOT need a StockAssist subscription for this. The broker already owns the user's market data entitlement — StockAssist simply consumes the feed on behalf of the authenticated user.

On broker disconnect, the Source Manager falls back to Yahoo Finance automatically. The frontend never notices the switch.

Full design, priority algorithm, and failover rules: MARKET_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md (authoritative).

# Broker Events

broker.connected

broker.disconnected

portfolio.synced

holding.updated

order.created

order.updated

order.executed

order.cancelled

trade.completed

funds.updated

margin.updated

Every event enters the Event Bus.

---

# AI Integration

After synchronization the following AI agents are notified:

Portfolio Manager

Trade Monitor

Risk Manager

Market Analyst

Notification Agent

Morning Report Agent

This ensures AI always works with the latest broker data.

# Broker Permissions

Before enabling trading verify:

Broker Connected

Market Open

Valid Session

Funds Available

Risk Check Passed

User Authorized

---

# Compliance

The platform must always:

Respect broker terms of service

Respect API rate limits

Never bypass authentication

Never impersonate users

Require explicit user consent before placing live orders

Clearly distinguish between AI recommendations and user-authorized executions

# Long-Term Vision

The Broker Engine should become a unified brokerage layer.

The rest of StockAssist AI should never depend on a specific broker implementation.

Adding a new broker should require only creating a new adapter while keeping the Trading Engine, Portfolio Engine, AI System, and UI unchanged.
