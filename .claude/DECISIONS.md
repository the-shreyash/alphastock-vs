# StockAssist AI
## Architecture & Product Decisions

Version: 1.1

Status: Active Development

---

# Purpose

This document records all major engineering, architecture, infrastructure, AI, product, and business decisions made during the development of StockAssist AI.

Every significant decision must be documented before implementation.

The objective is to ensure future developers understand:

• Why a decision was made

• Alternatives considered

• Trade-offs

• Long-term impact

This document acts as the project's Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

# ADR-026

Title

Provider-Independent Market Data Architecture

Date

2026-07-16

Decision

StockAssist AI is provider-independent. All market data enters the platform through a Market Gateway abstraction with per-provider adapters, governed by a Source Manager that selects the best provider per user.

Provider priority:

1. Connected Broker WebSocket (Zerodha, Upstox, Angel One, Fyers, Dhan)

2. Licensed Exchange Feed (future)

3. Yahoo Finance (always-available baseline)

Every provider produces one normalized market event model. The Market Engine, AI, and Frontend consume only normalized events and never know the provider — downstream provenance is limited to a source tier (streaming / delayed).

Connecting a broker automatically upgrades the user's feed to the broker's streaming WebSocket at no subscription cost — the broker already owns the user's data entitlement.

Premium never sells market data; it sells AI intelligence.

Reason

Yahoo Finance (polling) was the platform's real latency bottleneck, not the internal event-driven architecture. Depending on any single provider is a business and technical risk. Broker feeds give professional streaming data with zero data cost.

Consequences

• Adding a provider = one adapter + one normalizer + registry entry; nothing else changes.
• Never bypass the Market Gateway or Source Manager.
• Frontend and AI must never contain provider-specific logic.
• Failover is automatic and silent (broker → licensed → Yahoo → cached data with banner).

# Long-Term Vision

The Decisions document becomes the institutional memory of StockAssist AI.

Years from now, every developer should be able to understand why the platform evolved the way it did, reducing confusion, preventing repeated debates, and preserving engineering knowledge.
