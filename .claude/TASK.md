# Sprint 2 — Replace Mock Data

Status

COMPLETED

Objective

Replace every remaining mock dataset with real backend integration. Where live
data is unavailable, return an explicit "unavailable" state — never silently
fall back to random values.

Delivered

- Backend `market_data.py` reduced to factual reference metadata only
  (symbols, names, sectors). ALL random price/indicator/pick/chart/activity
  generators removed.
- `services/real_market.py` (Yahoo Finance / NSE) is the single live source:
  - Removed every simulated fallback (quotes, charts, top picks, global,
    commodities). Failures now return empty / `available:false`, never random.
  - Added live India VIX (`^INDIAVIX`), advance/decline breadth and market
    sentiment derived from live universe quotes.
  - Added live NSE/BSE stock search via Yahoo search API (`search_yahoo_stocks`),
    static metadata search only as offline fallback.
  - FII/DII already real (NSE); ultimate fallback now `available:false` with nulls.
- `services/cache.py` — shared cache: Redis when `REDIS_URL` is set, in-memory
  otherwise. Wired into real_market + news_service. `redis==5.0.8` added to
  requirements.
- `services/news_service.py` — deterministic keyword sentiment per article +
  `get_market_sentiment()` aggregate. New endpoint `GET /api/news/sentiment`.
- `server.py` — every user-facing path (overview, stock detail/live, explain,
  gemini analyze, top-picks, morning report, advisor, watchlist) returns
  explicit unavailable instead of simulated data. Removed `random.randint`
  news-score in full-report (now real news-mention sentiment). Fixed
  `source:"simulated"` mislabels. Scheduler/webhook signatures trimmed.
- Frontend (no UI redesign): News sentiment gauge now fetches
  `/news/sentiment`; Dashboard/Markets market-breadth read live
  `overview.advance_decline` (was hardcoded 1042/842/176) with unavailable
  states; Dashboard AI-activity placeholders removed (loading skeleton);
  StockPicks / MorningReport / InvestmentAdvisor / AIAssistant handle
  `available:false`; AIAssistant "Trade Ideas" now real top-picks (was
  hardcoded RELIANCE/TCS/HDFCBANK).

Verification

- Backend in-process suites: 49 passed (advisor, morning_report, webhooks,
  paper_trading, chart_patterns, activity_feed, backtesting, trade_coaching,
  setup_stats). Live smoke test confirmed real overview + search.
- Frontend: all changed JSX files parse; no stale identifiers.
- The HTTP-integration suites (test_backend/phase*) require a running server
  and are unaffected by these changes.

# Sprint 3 — Dashboard Completion

Status

COMPLETED

Objective

Complete the Dashboard with all planned widgets, live data integration,
improved loading states, animations, and performance. No UI redesign — extend
and improve the existing design language.

Delivered

- **Quick Actions Bar** — row of 6 quick-action buttons (New Trade, AI
  Analysis, Morning Report, Portfolio, Stock Picks, Market News) with
  navigation; responsive horizontal scroll on mobile.
- **Index Sparkline** — Nifty 50 stat-card now shows a mini intraday sparkline
  chart overlay (last 30 data points from `/stocks/^NSEI/chart?period=1D`).
- **Commodities & Forex Strip** — new 4-column strip showing Gold, Crude Oil,
  Silver, and USD/INR live prices from `/market/commodities`.
- **Watchlist Widget** — shows top 5 watchlist items with live quotes from
  `/watchlist`; empty state with "Add stocks" CTA.
- **Market News Widget** — latest 5 headlines from `/news` with sentiment
  indicators and source/time metadata.
- **Notifications Widget** — recent unread notifications from `/notifications`
  with severity color coding.
- **Recent Stocks** — localStorage-based recently viewed stocks (tracked from
  StockDetail page visits); horizontal scroll chip display.
- **Global Markets Widget** — international index prices from `/market/global`
  in a 2-column grid.
- **Market Status Badge** — MARKET OPEN / MARKET CLOSED indicator in header
  derived from `overview.market_status`.
- **Breadth Bar** — visual bar showing advance/decline ratio below the numeric
  breadth grid.
- **Performance** — all 11 API fetches fire in parallel on mount; core market
  data refreshes every 30s; greeting and action lists memoized; WebSocket
  fallback polling preserved.
- **Loading States** — improved skeleton loader includes quick-actions row and
  content grid placeholders.
- **Animations** — scroll-reveal staggering on every section; hover
  micro-interactions on cards and quick-action buttons.
- **StockDetail recent-stocks tracking** — viewing any stock detail page now
  writes the symbol to `localStorage(sa_recent_stocks)`, keeping the last 6
  entries for the Dashboard widget.

Verification

- Frontend production build passes (`craco build`).
- No new dependencies added.
- All existing JSX files unmodified except Dashboard.jsx and StockDetail.jsx.

# Sprint 7 — Broker Integration

Status

COMPLETED

Objective

Complete broker integration for Zerodha and Upstox using official broker APIs
only — OAuth, portfolio sync, orders, positions, margins, funds, trade
history, realtime WebSocket, token refresh/reconnect. No simulated trading.

Delivered

- **Broker adapter layer** (`backend/services/brokers/`) — provider-independent
  `BrokerAdapter` interface (base.py) with normalized Holding/Position/Order/
  Trade/Funds shapes and unified order statuses; `zerodha.py` (Kite Connect v3)
  and `upstox.py` (Upstox v2) adapters. Adding a broker = one new adapter.
- **Encrypted token storage** (`brokers/crypto.py`) — Fernet encryption at rest
  for access/refresh/public tokens (`BROKER_TOKEN_KEY` env or key derived from
  `JWT_SECRET`); legacy plaintext tokens auto-migrate to encrypted on first
  load. Tokens never returned to the browser or written to logs/audits.
- **Broker Engine** (`services/broker_engine.py`) — single entry point: per-user
  session lifecycle (exchange → store → expiry → refresh-or-reconnect),
  portfolio sync into `portfolios`/`holdings` collections, order
  place/modify/cancel with immutable `audit_logs` entries, per-broker status,
  startup session restore, WS push wiring.
- **Realtime streaming** (`brokers/stream.py`) — official feeds only: Kite
  ticker WebSocket (binary LTP tick parsing + JSON order updates) and Upstox
  portfolio-stream-feed (order updates); exponential-backoff reconnect;
  auth-expiry detection stops the stream and notifies the user. Updates
  forwarded to the app's per-user WebSocket (`broker_order_update`,
  `broker_price_tick`, `portfolio_synced`, `broker_status`) and persisted to
  `db.orders`; fills/rejections create notifications.
- **Unified API** (`/api/brokers`) — list/status, `{broker}/login-url`,
  `session`, public OAuth `callback` (Zerodha `request_token`+`uid`, Upstox
  `code`+`state`), `disconnect`, `sync`, `profile`, `holdings`, `positions`,
  `funds`, `margins`, `orders` (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE), `trades`. Pydantic
  validation (`BrokerOrderCreate`/`BrokerOrderModify`). Broker auth failures
  return 409 `BROKER_AUTH` (not 401, which the frontend treats as app-session
  loss); broker upstream errors 502; rate limits 429.
- **Legacy compatibility** — all `/api/zerodha/*` routes now delegate to the
  Broker Engine per-user (previously one global in-memory token shared by all
  users); `services/zerodha_service.py` reduced to a deprecated shim. Quick
  Trade no longer creates an OPEN trade when the broker order fails (was:
  silent `[SIM]` fallback). Emergency Stop cancels orders + liquidates
  positions per-user through the engine. `/zerodha/funds` now also returns the
  `available/used/total` aliases the Portfolio page reads (fixed undefined
  fields).
- **Frontend** — `services/brokerService.js` (single broker API gateway);
  Settings "Broker Accounts" card lists every supported broker with
  status/stream badges, Connect/Reconnect, Sync Now, Disconnect;
  `BrokerCallback.jsx` handles both Zerodha (`request_token`) and Upstox
  (`code`) redirects. No UI redesign — existing design language extended.
- **Config** — `.env` gains `UPSTOX_API_KEY`, `UPSTOX_API_SECRET`,
  `UPSTOX_REDIRECT_URL` (point at `/api/brokers/upstox/callback`) and optional
  `BROKER_TOKEN_KEY`.

Verification

- `tests/test_broker_integration.py`: 31 hermetic tests (crypto roundtrip +
  legacy migration, login URLs, session-expiry rules, response normalization,
  Kite binary tick parsing, engine storage/audit/status/disconnect, route
  registration, auth guards, validation). All broker HTTP mocked at
  `BrokerAdapter._request` — CI never touches real broker APIs.
- Full in-process backend suite: 116 passed.
- Frontend production build passes (`craco build`).

Notes / follow-ups

- Zerodha and Upstox retail tokens cannot be silently refreshed (daily expiry
  is a broker rule); the engine surfaces explicit reconnect states instead.
- Upstox market-data ticks use a protobuf feed — out of scope; order updates
  stream via the JSON portfolio feed. Zerodha ticks stream in LTP mode.
- Upstox order placement addresses instruments by instrument key; the adapter
  resolves symbols from the user's holdings/positions, or accepts
  `instrument_token` explicitly.

# Sprint 8 — Portfolio Intelligence

Status

COMPLETED

Objective

Turn the Portfolio surface into a production-grade, server-side Portfolio
Intelligence layer that is the single source of truth for holdings, allocation,
diversification, risk, P&L, dividends, performance and rebalancing — powered by
a broker-primary merge of real broker holdings and manual trades. No fabricated
data anywhere.

Delivered

- **Portfolio Engine** (`backend/services/portfolio_engine.py`) — the single
  source of truth. `build_holdings` performs a **broker-primary merge**: real
  broker holdings (`db.holdings`) are the portfolio, manual non-paper open
  trades (`db.trades`) are merged as a `source`-tagged layer, a symbol held in
  both keeps the broker row (no double-count), paper trades are excluded. Pure,
  unit-tested analytics: `compute_allocation` (by holding + sector),
  `compute_diversification` (HHI + effective-holdings + label),
  `compute_risk_score` (additive 0-100 with named, explainable factors),
  `compute_pnl` (realized + unrealized + best/worst), `compute_movers`,
  `build_suggestions` (concentration + AI-alert driven), `compute_dividends`
  (real trailing rates or explicit `available:false`), and the `build_intelligence`
  orchestrator.
- **Live dividend data** — `services/real_market.fetch_dividend_info` pulls real
  trailing annual dividend rate/yield from Yahoo `quoteSummary` (cached); missing
  data surfaces `available:false` and is never fabricated.
- **Performance / equity curve** — new `portfolio_snapshots` collection +
  `portfolio_snapshot_job` scheduled 4:05 PM IST (6th cron job). `get_performance`
  returns the equity curve + returns + best/worst day, or `available:false` until
  ≥2 real end-of-day snapshots exist (built forward, never back-filled).
- **API** — `GET /api/portfolio` and `/summary` now delegate to the engine
  (broker-inclusive, `source` + `day_change_pct` added). New:
  `GET /api/portfolio/intelligence`, `GET /api/portfolio/performance?range=`,
  `GET /api/portfolio/export` (CSV).
- **Frontend** (`frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.jsx`) — consumes the server bundle
  (drops all client-side math). The tab bar is now **functional**: Overview,
  Holdings (with Broker/Manual source badges), Performance (recharts equity curve
  + returns, real empty-state), Allocation (holding + sector), AI Review (wires
  `POST /api/ai/portfolio-review`), Transactions (`/api/trades/history`). Dividend
  section shows real income/yield or explicit unavailable; the Download button
  now exports CSV. No UI redesign — existing design language extended.

Verification

- `tests/test_portfolio_engine.py`: 18 hermetic tests (merge/de-dup, broker-mark
  fallback, allocation, diversification/HHI, P&L, movers, risk factors,
  suggestions, dividend real + unavailable paths, performance empty-state +
  returns, snapshot upsert, orchestrator bundle). Live market/dividend fetchers
  injected as stubs — CI never touches Yahoo.
- Full in-process backend suite: 232 passed (the 4 `test_phase*` failures are the
  pre-existing `requests`-based tests that require a running dev server + live
  Yahoo; unaffected by this sprint).
- Frontend production build passes (`craco build`); no warnings in Portfolio.jsx.

## TD-1: Backtest engine uses simulated trades

Description

`services/backtest_engine.py` generates simulated win/loss trades
(`random.seed`/`random.randint`) rather than replaying real historical OHLCV.

Reason

Historical backtesting over the full universe was out of scope for Sprint 2
(which targeted live market data surfaces).

Impact

Backtest results are illustrative, not real historical performance.

# Current Focus

This section should always contain the next highest-priority work.

Current Objective

Sprint 8 (Portfolio Intelligence) is COMPLETE — a server-side
`portfolio_engine` is now the single source of truth for the Portfolio surface:
broker-primary merge of real broker holdings + manual trades, allocation,
sector exposure, diversification (HHI), an explainable risk score, realized +
unrealized P&L, real dividend estimates (or explicit unavailable), a
forward-built equity curve (daily snapshots), and rebalancing suggestions. The
Portfolio page consumes the bundle with functional tabs, AI review, and CSV
export.

Next: Milestone 3 trading surfaces (orders UI, positions dashboard) on top of
the /api/brokers endpoints, then admin portal and payments/subscriptions.
